# OOPs
Examples:
The Four major Pillars of OOPs are:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Abstraction:

For Example, In a keyboard, we have circuits and It is connected to the CPU. So While pressing the key we dont know about the inside happenings of the keyboard. We only know that When the keyboard is pressed It will display a similar letter in the screen incase we are typing. So this is how Abstraction works. Abstraction ie., Exposing necessary data

Encapsulation:

Next When the key is pressed some kind of message runs through the circuit of the keyboard which is sent to the CPU.CPU analyses that request and accordingly displays the pressed text in the screen. So here we only know that pressing the key will display the letter but In the meanwhile we are totally unaware of the happening inside the circuits. This is Encapsulation ie.,emphasis on hiding the data

Inheritance:

There are many keyboards brands available in the market but the similarity between them is that they follow more or less the same prototype as the Keyboard available in the year 2000. So basically they are inheriting the properties of the older generation of keyboards plus they are modifying the newer keyboards with some extra functionalities..

Polymorphism:

Polymorphism means Poly[Many] + Morphism[Forms]. It is the ability of the object to behave differently under different situation.. For Example while writing a word document you will be using the up/down arrows for moving up and down in the document but while playing a car game u will be using the same keys for moving your car in the game. So the same keys are behaving differently on various scenarios and this is called polymorphism.
